# Facy

Facy was designed to be a simple website that has similar features to FaceBook / Google+.

The main reason for the creation of Facy was to become familar with TypeScript, React, and WebPack among other frontend web tools.

This project is no longer worked on / maintained but is kept for historical reasons.
